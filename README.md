# **PetClassifier: Classifying Cats and Dogs with Deep Learning**

Welcome to PetClassifier, where we explore the world of our beloved pets using cutting-edge deep learning techniques. In this repository, we have developed a pet classification model that specializes in distinguishing between cats and dogs. Our dataset, sourced from Microsoft, consists of over 24,000 high-quality images, offering a comprehensive view of these adorable companions.

## Project Overview
Our objective is to build an intelligent system capable of accurately classifying images as either cats or dogs. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and image processing, our model has been trained to discern the unique features of each pet category.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-Learn
- Deep Learning
- Image Processing

## Access the Dataset
To explore and utilize the dataset used in this project, visit the [Cats-Dogs Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset). Follow the dataset's page for download and usage instructions.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset comprises over 24,000 images, categorized into two classes:
- Cats/: Images of adorable cats
- Dogs/: Pictures of delightful dogs
